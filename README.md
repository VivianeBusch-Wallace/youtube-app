# youtube-app
##Explanation

This page is my own recreation of the youtube page in dark mode. It is based on a screenshot of a random youtube page (in this case Paris Hilton's, not saying I'm a fan or anything, it was just the one I received).

In my CSS file I am using flex boxes. And right now the videos are actually just pictures and the links also haven't been linked up to anything yet.
As this is a work in progress, the app hasn't been completed yet.
